We suppose read the source file to get more comments. The files:
Data Generator - datagen.cpp.
Main Program - main.cpp.

The data generator may run a very long time if hard to generate the random data easily, wait, or choose a larger width and height.
We recommend using TDM-GCC9.2.0 to compile,
the C++ standard shall be C++11 or above.
